Regression Modeling Techniques
(Fixed Modelling, Real Time Modelling and Modeling Based on Test Data)

1. Linear Regression: y = f(x1,x2,â€¦,xn) where the model is assumed to be linear in each xi, with coefficients which are unknown and are the model parameters. Once we get the training data we estimate the parameters using the Least Squares Estimator.  

2. Polynomial Regression: An extension of the linear regression technique in which if we wish to add quadratic, cubic and other powers of the controllable factors, we take some xp equal to the needed power term and compute its coefficient using the same above least squares approach. 

3. Principal Component Regression (Biased Estimation): Some of the controllable factors may be (approximate) linear combination of some other dominating controllable factors which leads to rank loss, thus creating computation difficulty and deteriorating the quality of estimators by shooting up their variance. To avoid the above problem, we take the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the matrix of controllable factors and based upon the values of the diagonal matrix we decide how many parameters to consider. This technique is called the Principal Component Analysis.

4. Recursive Least Squares (Real time estimation of parameters): We are given an initial set of data. Using the data we estimate the model parameters. Now when the model is put into action, it estimates the target value based upon the values previous value of estimators and after that when one cycle is complete and realization is done, the estimators update themselves thus the model is said to learn from mistake committed in estimating the target variable. This technique is called the Recursive Least Squares Parameters estimation.

5. Lazy Learning(Locally Weighted Regression): One of the simplest and computationally most demanding techniques of modeling, Lazy Learning which is actually based on the following idea. Once you  get the test data, based on certain criteria(weight function), you start assigning weights to the training points. Based upon the weights assigned or priority wise you estimate the model parameters.
